          <p>Sometimes it’s hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill. Try sharing that bill week in, week out and you might encounter more than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated payment system takes care of the rest. You need never talk money or who owes what.</p>

        <h2>A framework built for the long term</h2>

        <p>Childcare is for the long term. And you need a framework you can count on that gives your share long term viability and success. That’s why we’ve defined Hapu around our three tribal principles; clearly defined process, transparency over money and equality of participation.</p>
